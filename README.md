# Relapse to cocaine-seeking is regulated by medial habenula Nr4a2 in mice
Childs & Morabito et al. 2024 (Cell Reports, in press)

This Repository contains the code used for data processing and analysis in our manuscript
titled "Relapse to cocaine-seeking is regulated by medial habenula Nr4a2 in mice". In this study
we used single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to profile the habenula in four different groups of mice to
study the molecular changes following a cocaine reinstatement behavioral experiment and manipulation
of the transcription factor Nr4a2. Here we list the major sections of the paper and provide links to the data
analysis steps in each part.


## Clustering analysis (Figure 2)

## Transcription factor (TF) network analysis (Figure 3)

## Differential expression analysis in behaviorally naive mice (Figure 4)

## Differential expression analysis in behaviorally experienced mice (Figure 5)

## Co-expression network analysis in medial habenula neurons (Figure 6)
